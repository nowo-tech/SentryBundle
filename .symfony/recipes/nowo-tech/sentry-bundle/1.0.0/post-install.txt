The default configuration file has been created at config/packages/nowo_sentry.yaml

This bundle extends the official Sentry Symfony bundle with enhanced event listeners and a safe error reporter service.

Key features:
- Enhanced request context with user and session information
- Automatic filtering of access denied exceptions
- Uptime bot detection and handling
- Safe error reporter service (SentryErrorReporter) that never breaks your application

The bundle works out of the box with default settings. You can customize the behavior by editing the configuration file.

Important: Make sure you have configured Sentry DSN in your config/packages/sentry.yaml file.

For more information, see the bundle documentation:
- README.md for usage examples
- docs/CONFIGURATION.md for complete configuration reference
- docs/UPGRADE.md for upgrade instructions
